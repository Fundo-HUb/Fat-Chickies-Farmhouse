            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                At Fat Chickies Farmhouse, our story begins with a simple vision: to create a haven where the warmth of family and the joy of farm life come together. Our journey started with a passion for the land and a desire to share the authentic, wholesome experiences of country living with others. 
                We named it Fat Chickies Farmhouse, inspired by our cheerful chickens that add a touch of whimsy and character to our property. Thank you for being a part of our story. We invite you to make new memories with us and discover the charm of Fat Chickies Farmhouse!

            <h2>What Makes Us Free-Range?</h2>
            <p>
                At Fat Chickies Farmhouse, our definition of free-range is living with the intention of celebrating nature. What makes us free-range is our commitment to the principle of freedom and embracing the spirit of nature. Our chickens have the freedom to roam freely, allowing them to express their natural behavior in a cage-free environment!

            <h2>PET Packaging</h2>
            <p>
                At Fat Chickies Farmhouse, we believe in keeping nature pure and limiting the use of products that may affect the environment. Thus, we use Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) packaging. Not only is our packaging environmentally friendly, but it is also recyclable and reliable in keeping our products safe and free from harmful chemicals.
